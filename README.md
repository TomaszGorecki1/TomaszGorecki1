### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Tomasz GÃ³recki from Poland, and I am currently focused on learning and mastering my web-development skills. Right now I am fully concentrated on learning javascript, even though I was tought a little about it in school (I'am in programming class in technical high-school) I want to progress more and do more exciting projects so I'm participating in Jonas Schmedtmann's course. In addition to studying I work as an apprentice in Polish dev-company APR-SYSTEM. I am planning to learn some stuff about UI/UX design to be able to provide better solutions to design problems I encounter.
