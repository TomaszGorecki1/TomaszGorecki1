I am Tomasz GÃ³recki from Poland I am 17 years old, and I am currently focused on learning and mastering my web-development skills. Right now I am fully concentrated on learning react, even though I was tought a little about it in school (I'am in programming class in technical high-school) I want to progress more and do more exciting projects so I'm participating in few courses. In addition to studying I work as an apprentice in Polish dev-company APR-SYSTEM. I am planning to learn some stuff about UI/UX design to be able to provide better solutions to design problems I encounter. I am planning to do my own website and display whole portfolio in simple way. For sure my learning how to code is never ending story, I can see a lot of opurtunities for me to learn new things and my goal is to be able to build really big applications in huge teams.

## Skills: BOOTSTRAP / JS / HTML / CSS / C++ / React / C# /Git / Wordpress
